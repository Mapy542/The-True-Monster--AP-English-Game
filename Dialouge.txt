You have just been born, but let's not get into the details.
Your parents have named you Victor, Victor Frankenstein, and they know you will go on to do great things... But being born into a wealthy family certainly has its advantages.
Your parents are very close, and they love spending every second with you.
*3
You are 3 years old.
They don't detract form your parents love of you, but I suppose I should mention you do in fact have brothers.
Ernest is 1 year old, and William was born today.
The larger family is the most dear thing to you, as there is more love to share, but it has been a taxing three years on your mother.

She proposes the family take a vacation to Lake Como.

Lake Como was the right decision.
Everyone is having the greatest time. Your siblings and you are continuously playing at the beach. Sports, sandcastles, swimming, and plenty of other kids to play with.
Your parents are equally enjoying the trip. Your father spends his time in the bar conversing with the other adults, and betting ridiculous sums on 8 ball pool.
Your mother enjoys perusing the shopping district, and walking with some of her new companions.

However, on her walk, she finds the most beautiful baby girl that has been abandoned after her mother died. Does your family adopt her and bring her back?

You welcome Elizabeth into you family. She is a bundle of joy and excitement that completes the family. She is very smart, and you both quickly become best friends.

The family returns to Naples and you enter the school system.
*6
In school you find a certain excitement learning. The way mathematical equations can be exact models of the real world is amazing.
However there are other people in the school besides you, your family, and your teachers. And they give you weird looks... You family urges you to try and socialize. "Make some friends," they say, but you don't know if thats the best idea.

Do you go over and try to make a friend?
*7
You go find and boy in your class and make a conversation. You introduce yourself and he does the same, "I'm Henry Clerval."
Success! You got yourself your first friend.

However, your brother Earnest wandered off while you were gone and tried to make his own friends. It didn't go so well to say the least.
Earnest was made fun of and got very angry. He shouted at a kid named Terry Rorchact to the point where Terry punched back just so Earnest would shut up. Now Earnest is in critical condition.
*8
The family surrounds the hospital bed that Earnest lays in. The doctor has said the punch to his head caused too much damage, and that it is unlikely Earnest will survive.

Then Earnest looks at your. He says, "I love you all." And never moves again.

He has died of dissin` terry.
